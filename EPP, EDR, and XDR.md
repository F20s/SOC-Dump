# EPP
An Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) aims to prevent attacks on endpoint devices from threats such as malware, zero-day vulnerabilities, and fileless attacks. EPP solutions use a variety of methods to detect attacks, including signature-based matching, blacklisting or whitelisting, sandbox testing, and behavioral analysis.

# EDR
EPPs are typically cloud-based, enabling easy data collection and analysis, and often include an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution as an optional component. EDR solutions are used to respond to security incidents that have already occurred on an endpoint device. EDR tools can identify indicators of compromise (IoC), provide real-time alerts, integrate forensics, and automatically remediate threats.

# XDR
Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an integrated security and incident response platform that collects and correlates data from endpoints and other parts of the IT environment, providing a unified view of cybersecurity. XDR standardizes security operations, enriches data sources, and enables faster and more comprehensive investigations to reduce incident response times. Ultimately, the goal of XDR is to improve the productivity of security teams and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of an organization.

# differences
Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) aims to prevent attacks on endpoint devices, while Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) responds to security incidents that have already occurred on an endpoint. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an integrated platform that collects and correlates data from multiple sources for faster and more comprehensive investigations. While EPPs and EDRs are often integrated, XDR provides a unified view of cybersecurity across an organization's IT environment.
